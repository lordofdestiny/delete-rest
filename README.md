# delete-rest

This is a simple command line utility for selecting files to keep and deleting the rest. 
It is meant to be used in a directory with a large number of files, that have names differed by a
pattern, and are numbered sequentially.

It was primarily written for photos, but it can be used for any type of file, as long as the
filenames are numbered sequentially.
